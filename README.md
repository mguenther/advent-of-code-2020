# Advent of Code 2020

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code season 2020. My programming language of choice was Python this year. I've done a lot of Python 2.x before, but this was 10 years back or so. Although I used Python on various occasions over the past years (mostly small utility scripts), I've never got the chance to work on anything larger. So, I took the opportunity to brush up my Python skills and learn a few new things along the way: Working with the 3.x line of Python (finally), using NumPy (for solving puzzle 11 a bit faster), using type hints etc.

I did use CPython. This was mainly due to convenience (I had an installation lying around on my system), although this meant that some of the scripts took their fair share of time to complete.
